Role Access Lists
=================
#Why use this portlet
Have you ever been in need of a way to restrict Control Panel access to administrative users when they attempt login from outside of your network ?

Well, hereâ€™s a portal-wise simple security plugin restricting login to authorized users when they attempt access without having the desired combination of IP address and portal role set by the portal administrator herewith.

#Installation
Just put the code in a directory, in the portlers directory of your Liferay SDK.

#Building
Just run the ant script.

#Documentation
The documentation is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f6maZ-CN93fIRz5r_7M5eGtoCBZSPOn_ENdzLu6GTA8).But you can find it also under the help but in the portlet.
